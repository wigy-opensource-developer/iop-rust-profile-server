[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Fermat-ORG/rust-iop-profile-server.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Fermat-ORG/rust-iop-profile-server)

Internet of People is a public infrastructure for enabling people to find each
other, connect to each other and exchange information between each other without
going through private networks or intermediary centralized data stores.

The home node network is a peer-to-peer network that allows mobile devices to
host profiles, query and access other profiles and receive push notifications
from other mobile devices.
